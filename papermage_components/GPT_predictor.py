I would like you to do named entity recognition task given above specific entity definitions. They are concepts from materials science literature. Now would you like to recognize entities in an article talking about materials science? Please only provide results in clean JSON format without any irrelevant content. 
Provide your output as below format:
{
"entities": [
    {
    "entity": "entity1 name",
    "category": "entity2 category",
    "context": "entity2 context"
    },
    {
    "entity": "entity2 name",
    "category": "entity2 category",
    "context": "entity2 context"
    }
]
}
In your output, please eliminate content in any format other than json!!!
Again, please remove anything that is not in json format in your output!!!!!!
Please make sure your output is in json format and it should starts with { "entities": [ { and ends with ] }
make sure you have , to separate two entity { }
Below comes the article I would like you to process:
