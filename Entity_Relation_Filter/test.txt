In this paper , we report on a novel additively manu- factured Al-10.5Ce-3.1Ni-1.2Mn wt .
% alloy which displays excellent creep resistance relative to cast high- temperature aluminum alloys at 30 0–40 0 ° C. The creep resistance of this alloy is attributed to a high volume fraction ( ∼ 35 % ) of submicron intermetallic strengthening phases which are coarsening-resistant for hundreds of hours at 350 ° C. The results herein demonstrate that additive manufacturing provides opportunities for development of creep-resistant aluminum alloys that may be used in bulk form in the 250–400 ° C temperature range .
Pathways for further development of such alloys are identiﬁed .

Introduction Consideration of creep deformation in aluminum ( Al ) alloys is critical for long-lifetime component design , especially in the grow- ing number of applications which take advantage of the relatively high thermal and electrical conductivities of Al .
As the application space for additive manufacturing ( AM ) of Al increases , it is there- fore important to understand how AM processing affects creep be- havior , especially in the 200–450 ° C temperature range where AM Al alloys are targeted as replacements for denser and/or more ex- pensive steels and Ti alloys [ 1 ] .
The creep resistances of a few stud- ied AM Al alloys are not promising .
